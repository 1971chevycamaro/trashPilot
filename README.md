# trashPilot
its total garbage  
this is an experimental repository to document my knowledge of openpilots codebase. inside you will find tools to test and replicate various snippets of openpilots codebase. atm it is only the webcam capture and sharing architecture.

## setup
VScode should take care of you  
make a virutal environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if i keep it updated)  
## usage
start webcam_server_robust.py  
explore the results with any of the webcam_* files!  
observe your pretty face
